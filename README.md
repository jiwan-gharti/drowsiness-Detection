# Drowsiness Detection Using OpenCV and Deep learning models:
This code can detect your eyes and alert when the user is drowsy.



### Code Requirements
> The example code is in Python (version 2.7 or higher will work).

    - ** pygame **
    - ** numpy **
    - ** cv2  **
    - ** keras


### Descriptions:
> A computer vision system that can automatically detect drowsiness in a real-time video stream and then play an alarm if the appears to be drowsy.

### Algorithms:
> I use the haar cascade feature for the face recognition
* **Train **
> I use the one of the best high level deep learning framework keras.
* model:
> Model is saved using keras in file format .h5 which lies inside the models folder

### Execution
> To run the code, type python Drowsiness_Detection.py
``` 
python Drowsiness_Detection.py 
```
